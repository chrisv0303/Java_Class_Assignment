# Chapter 2 & 3 Notes
	
	Chapter 2 Notes
- Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables which represents the state of an object.
- Things an object can do are called methods which represents the behavior of an object.
- A class is a blueprint for an object and it tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to make an object of that particular type.
- It's important to have two classes - One class for the type of object you're creating, and the other class is to test your new class.
- The Dot Operator (.) gives access to an object's state (instance variables) and behavior (methods). 
- The two uses of the main() method are:
	- to test your real class
	- to launch/start your Java application

	Chapter 3 Notes
- Variables must have a data type and a name. Variables have two types:
	- Primitive variables: hold fundamental values that include boolean, char, integer, float/double numbers.
	- Reference variables: hold object references that represent a way to access an object.
- There are ways to assign a value to a variable:
	- type a literal value after the equals sign
	- assign the value of one variable to another
	- use an expression combining the two variables
- A primitive variable is full of bits representing the actual value of the variable, while an object reference variable is full of bits representing a way to get to the object. The Dot Operator (.) is beneficial for a reference variable.
- Arrays are considered as ojects, it can never in itself be a primitive, whether they hold primitive or reference variables. Every element in an array holds a variable.
